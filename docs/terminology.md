# Terminology

## Gno.land

Gno.land is a layer-1 blockchain that integrates various cutting-edge technologies, including Tendermint2, GnoVM, Proof-of-Contributions consensus mechanism, on-chain governance through a new DAO framework with support for sub-DAOs, and a unique licensing model that allows open-source code to be monetized by default.

Gno.land aims to offer security, high-quality contract libraries, and scalability to other Gnolang chains, while also prioritizing interoperability with existing and emerging chains.

Post mainnet launch, Gno.land aims to integrate IBCv1 to connect with existing Cosmos chains and implement ICS1 for security through the existing chains. Afterwards, the platform plans to improve IBC by adding new capabilities for interchain smart-contracts.

## Gnolang

Gnolang is the main programming language used across the tech stacks that power the Gnoland blockchain. Gnolang can be thought of as an interpreted version of Golang. As Gnolang is approximately 99% identical to Golang, it allows developers to utilize the rich libraries of Golang to greatly simplify application development.

A notable advantage of becoming a Gnolang developer is that you can choose become a blockchain core developer or a dapp developer without having to learn an extra language, as Gnolang is the universal language of Gnoland.

If you're interested in becoming a contributor to this novel language, visit the official [`gno`](https://github.com/gnolang/gno) repository.

## Gnoland Virtual Machine (GnoVM)

GnoVM is a virtual machine that interprets Gnolang, a custom version of Golang optimized for blockchains, featuring automatic state management, full determinism, and idiomatic Go. It works with Tendermint2 and enables smarter, more modular, and transparent appchains with embedded smart-contracts. It can be used in TendermintCore, forks, and non-Cosmos blockchains.

## Realm (Smart Contracts)

Realms are smart contracts written in Gnolang. The potentials of realms are endless - you can create virtually any application in your mind with built-in composability, transparency, and censorship resistance. Here are some ideas of what you can build with realms:

* Self-custodial financial exchanges (decentralized exchanges).
* Lending platforms with better rates.
* Transparent insurance systems.
* Fair and accessible voting systems.
* Logistics and supply chain networks.

## Tendermint2

Tendermint2 is a branch of Tendermint, a software that manages secure state replication across nodes of a blockchain. Tendermint2 aims to solve the following challenges:

* Complete Amino
* Optimize performance
* Remove external dependencies
* Fix non-determinism in consensus tests
* Remove gRPC

The full list of proposals for Tendermint2 can be found [here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint2#what-is-already-proposed-for-tendermint2). If you're interested in contributing to the next iteration of one of the most performant and battle-tested consensus software that powers the Internet of Blockchains, visit the official [`tendermint2`](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint2) repository.
